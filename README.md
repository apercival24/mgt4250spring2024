## Project Description
### Questions of interest
How do pollution rates correlate with economic growth globally, and what implications might this have for environmental and public health policies?

### Importance
The question "How do pollution rates correlate with economic growth globally, and what implications might this have for environmental and public health policies?" is crucial for numerous reasons. It addresses the environmental impact of industrial activities linked to economic development, which is essential for sustainable growth strategies. The correlation between pollution and GDP is also pivotal for assessing public health outcomes, as increased pollution can lead to respiratory diseases and other health issues. This understanding aids policymakers in devising regulations that balance economic and environmental health, making economic planning more sustainable. Furthermore, global comparisons could offer insights that help countries learn from one another, potentially adopting practices that maintain or even enhance environmental quality without compromising economic growth.

## Data Description
The data for this analysis can be accessed and downloaded via the following steps: 
- Visit [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/programmerrdai/outdoor-air-pollution].
- Then press the download link and download "outdoor-pollution-rate-vs-gdp.csv" file. 
- Finally save the file to your computer.

The dataset "outdoor-pollution-rate-vs-gdp.csv" is made of data comparing outdoor pollution rates to GDP across various countries over specific years. It includes columns for country names, the years of data collection, pollution rate indicators, and GDP figures (total or per capita). This dataset is instrumental in analyzing how economic growth patterns affect environmental health across different geographical locations and times. Such analysis can reveal trends and insights that are crucial for formulating public health policies and economic strategies that prioritize environmental sustainability alongside economic development.
